                    language users won't realizing the existence of grammars and other linguistic functions until the
                    age of 4~5, when they've reached certain level of cognitive system development.

                    Some languages, especially those who look 0% alike Latin-based languages, can form very different
                    grammar system. For instance, Chinese doesn't have alphabet, It has no singular and plural like
                    English, it does not have tenses in the Western language sense, it has no genders (masculine,
                    feminine or neuter) and nouns and verbs never change, there are no changing endings. The "grammar"
                    is a highly context-based "pattern" rather than a structural chart to be explained. Therefore, to
                    develop computer literature program for these languages can be a very different task, usually means
                    more tricker works, especially under the condition of which
                    those regions can generally lack the resources of technical and academic sponsorships.
