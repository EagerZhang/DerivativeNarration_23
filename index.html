        <br> <br>
        <div class="type_p2">
            Since my middle school year, I am a longtime lover of linguistics. I was born as a
            native speaker of Chinese, am using English for working at United States. I used to do sports news
            translations as a volunteer in Japanese,
            and knows some grammar knowledge of Russian, Spanish and other languages I randomly picked up. What
            linguistic studies bring me is, very often in my life, I'm curious about the relationship between language
            and thinking itself.
            <br> <br>
            Remember when we were all kids. You barely remembered how you started speaking, but you really did, and that
            definitely made your parents' day from a while ago. You slowly learned how to speak in your mother tongue,
            most of the time it was gibberish and the adults around your were to train you, with the only method they
            knew: to tell you right or wrong, and repeat. By mimicking with your ears, you then can talk like a little
            chatty camedian, and your
            parents started to teach you how to write your name -- could be a pain in the ass for some Chinese kids to
            draw that square word monsters. And then, you went to school, when your skills really started to take off:
            your made huge progress in reading and writing,
            sometimes because you loved it, but sometimes it's the homework, grading system and grumpy professors that
            pushed your forward.
            <br> <br>
            Well, this is your journey of learning language, but does it have anything to do with our theme today?
            Sometimes I look at the <a class="cover_links" href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, the
            golden baby of many tech parents behind it, and think: actually, we didn't really exceed the limit of
            imagination as human being when we created GPTs: we train them just like a human baby. At the beginning we
            make it mimick us, "us" is a <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language model</a>. It can be simple just as your
            mom repeating: "eat-an-apple". And then, we make the program eat more, such as an <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a>, which can contain trillions of words,
            just like you memorized a whole library. We also <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">created a tutor</a> for an AI
            student, which can tell if it is
            doing a great job and kick its ass sometimes, so it can move forward itself. A beginner AI writer might only
            read a few articles
            and write its own text through <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov process</a>; an "experienced" AI writer might
            think wisely with its <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNN</a>, after "reading" millions of word
            materials.
            <br> <br>
            If you find my interpretation kinda helpful, but still scary because you're not a tech person and don't know
            how to start, I'm also in your shoes. When I first saw the <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16768582/harry-potter-ai-fanfiction">AI-generated Harry Potter
                New Episode</a>, I was caught by the idea of using rules, digits and parameters to write literature,
            which not only has logic statments, but also contains emotions, styles, narratives, and poetry. But hold on:
            who said AI is
            the first being that uses rules to generate subtle emotional interpretations? Talking about poems, from <a
                class="cover_links" href="https://www.knowitall.org/photo/what-haiku-what-are-rules">Haiku</a> to <a
                class="cover_links" href="https://nosweatshakespeare.com/sonnets/">Shakespeare Sonnets</a>, human really
            are into the concept of inventing small machines for the writers to fill in their creativities. Another good
            example of we treating ourselves as machine could be Raymond Queneau's <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style">Exercices de Style</a>: a little passage was
            rewritten 100 times with different styles just to tell a same story. I see strong connections between these
            early writing practice with contemporary AI training: poetry is hard and intangible, but we can look for
            shortcuts to weave it, and even shape readers' mind of preceiving it.
            <br> <br>
            The beauty of machine writing is not simply making it another intelligence just like a human brain. The
            dynamic, generative nature of a machine will give us unexpected results, which comes from trillions of
            micro calculations from its silicon neuro cells but when we read it, we use our intuitives, which is
            technically overthinking (admit it!). Thousands of <a class="cover_links"
                href="https://www.ifanr.com/1311360">zombie accounts</a>, created by AI in Chinese social media
            platform, were wandering around with generated fragmental posts, and collected by the lovers when some of
            the zombie posts just sound like what Nietzsche would say. Languages are infrastructure of human
            civilization, but there're moments when language is just itself, just like what the followers of <a
