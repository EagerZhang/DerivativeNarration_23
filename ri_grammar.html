                    language users won't realize the existence of grammars and other linguistic functions until the
                    age of 4~5, when they've reached certain level of cognitive system development.

                    Some languages, especially those who look 0% alike Latin-based languages, can form very different
                    grammar system. For instance, Chinese doesn't have alphabet, It has no singular and plural like
                    English, it does not have tenses in the Western language sense, it has no genders (masculine,
                    feminine or neuter) and nouns and verbs never change, there are no changing endings. The "grammar"
                    is a highly context-based "pattern" rather than a structural chart to be explained. Therefore, to
                    develop computer literature program for these languages can be a very different task, usually means
                    more trickier works, especially under the condition of which
                    those regions can generally lack the resources of technical and academic sponsorships.

                    can definitely use a one-line syntax, but I'll recommend we leave it like this as a template, and
                    I'll share how to change the line number in the next section.

                    Now let's take a look at the actual grammar part. In the json file, follow this standard stucture to
                    start your big bracket container. Make sure the var name ("<code
                        class="code_area">(simple_sentence)</code> ") matches the one in the other .js file, so the
                    other file will be able to identify it and pull the data from the sheet:
                </div>

                <br>
                <code class="code_area">

                    let simple_sentence = {
                        
                        [your grammar stuff] 
                      
                    }

                <br> <br>

                <div>
                    Now, how to start a simple dynamic sentence? Take the basic "subject-verb-object" structure as an
                    example here. We're replacing the "subject" with "<code
                        class="code_area">subject1 | subject2 | subject3 | ...</code>" here, and use a method <code
                        class="code_area">$subject</code> to represent the dynamic placeholder. For verb and object --
                    vice versa. The complete grammar sheet is as below:
                </div>

                <br>
                <code class="code_area">

                    Be very careful to not create any typos with JSON! Especially: semi-colon, coma, quote marks, etc.
                    Unlike html and css file which can tolerate old and new syntaxes and even small typos, JSON file
                    tends to require you to make it 100% stick to the textbook.

                            Case of Benjamin Button</a> depicted the life of Benjamin Button, a fictional role that when
                        his mind ages, his physical body age grows reversely. He was born as an old man and died looking
                        like a baby. The movie featured his bizarred life journey and how he witnesses other people's
                        life as
                        his own life rewinds towards an opposite direction.

                    <div>Some people were born to sit by a river. <br>
                        Some get struck by lightning.<br>
                        Some have an ear for music.<br>
                        Some are artists.<br>

                    <div>
                        Now, what if we can make this poem start moving, as it is partly structured, but also we see the
                        beauty of "randomized life stories"?
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        The major part of the code is generally the same. Here are a few significant changes in your
                        JSON part:
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        ----- In your grammar JSON file -----
                    </div>


                    <br>
                    <code class="code_area">

                    start: "$line0 % $line1 % $line2  % $line3 % $line4  % $line5  % $line6  % $line7",
             
                </code>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <div>
                        You might already discover that, for RiGrammar object, you can literally make one <code
                            class="code_area">$method</code> inside another <code class="code_area">$method</code>, to
                        create more branching possibilities of your poetic machine.
                    </div>
                    <br>
              
                    <div>
                       The <code class="code_area">%</code> represents a line-changing moment, it'll be pulled by the main js file as it'll expand in a correct, once in a line format.
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <div>
                        Besides, you can also create a logic element inside one method, such as the syntax here:
                     </div>

                     <br>
                     <code class="code_area">
 
                        'line2': '$first_word  $be ($bad_at | $good_at) $verb_ing;',
              
                 </code>
                     <br>
                
                     <div>
                        It means either the method <code class="code_area">$bad_at</code> or <code class="code_area">$good_at</code> will be chosen when it hits this part, the ratio of possibility is 50/50.
                      </div>
